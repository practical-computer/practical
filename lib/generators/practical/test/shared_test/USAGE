Description:
    Creates a new module for tests that should be shared across all apps that use the framework; which can be included
    in an app's test files as needed, in `Practical::Test::Shared`

Example:
    bin/rails generate practical:test:shared_test auth/models/user/base

    This will create:
        app/lib/practical/test/shared/auth/models/user/base.rb
